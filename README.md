## Backstory of Riparto
> I came of knowledge about this card game by searching through an old box of letters from a cellar of my aunt. I was to find some mail of quite trivial urgency. Instead, I found correspondance of a man I possess no insight into. Anyways, he was inviting (I assume) someone from the ancestry of the previous owners, as I haven't been able to recognize their surname. In a series of letters he explained the rules of the game; most I have found in the first letter - I presume the later correspondance was to explain some rules that the guest had had misunderstood...

Post Scriptum: I could not find any information on this game whatsoever, therefore I find it safe to assume it was exclusive to the aforementioned household.

# Riparto Game Rules



### Remember! (From testing) Riparto is a trick-taking game based on *strategy*, which is very different to most card-games! and may seem awfully simple if played with persons without it! (as the game requires surgical precision in play)

## Preparation
	•	Use a 36-card Piemontesi (one of the few French-suited Italian card-) deck; however you can use a Poker deck using cards Ace through 10 to 6.
 
	•	3 or 4 players.

## Dealing (exact sequence)
	1.	Choose dealer at random.
 
	2.	Dealer disperses 3 cards to each player.
 
	3.	Dealer places "il primo insieme" (a set of 3 or 4 cards — size determined by player count; 3 means 3, 4 means 4) face down in the table’s centre.
 
	4.	Dealer deals 2 cards to each player.
 
	5.	Dealer places "il secondo insieme" (a second set of 3 or 4 cards) in the centre.
 
	6.	Dealer finishes by dealing 2 more cards to each player.
 
(At this point each player has their *almost* final hand; the two "insiemi" remain to be distributed by the "ripartitore".)

## Bidding
	•	Each player (starting from the person on the dealer’s left) bids an exact number of points they expect to take this deal (see scoring).

	•	The highest bidder becomes the "ripartitore"

## Ripartitore’s actions (in order)
	1.	The ripartitore distributes the cards of il primo insieme and il secondo insieme. For each insieme the ripartitore first takes a single card for themself and then hands out the remaining cards of that insieme to the other players.
 
	2.	The ripartitore may raise their prior bid (only an increase is permitted).
 
	3.	The ripartitore may declare a suit hierarchy, from strongest to weakest, (e.g. Picche/Spades>Quadri/Diamonds>Cuori/Hearts>Fiori/Clubs) or declare no hierarchy). That hierarchy governs the peculiar trump rules below.

## Trump mechanics (hierarchy-driven)
	•	A card of suit X trumps the card led if X sits two places above the led suit in the declared hierarchy.
 
	•	Consequently the two least-important suits possess no trump power.
 
	•	The second-most-important suit trumps only the least-important suit.
 
	•	The most-important suit trumps the two least-important suits.
 
	•	The two most-important suits cannot be trumped.

For instance, using the previous example of a hierarchy, Picche/Spades trump Cuori/Hearts and Fiori/Clubs, whereas Quadri/Diamonds trump only Fiori/Clubs. *

## Play (tricks)
	•	Ripartitore leads the first trick; the winner of each trick leads the next.
 
	•	Card rank, strongest → weakest: A, R/K, D/Q, F/J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
 
	•	Players must follow suit when able; if void, they may play any card.
 
	•	Trumping the lead card of the trick is not required.

## Scoring
	•	Each trick collected = 1 point.
 
	•	The final trick grants an additional 1-point bonus.
 
	•	The last three tricks together are given a collective 5-point value; combined with the usual 1 point per trick and the last-trick bonus this makes the final three-trick span worth 9 points total (5 + 3 + 1 = 9).

## Outcomes (round and match)
	•	If the ripartitore takes exactly the number of hand-points he declared, he is said to have won the deal (round). These points are then added to the ripartitore’s overall balance
	•	If the ripartitore fails (takes more or fewer hand-points than he declared), he is deducted the amount of hand-points he declared from his overall balance.
	•	When the ripartitore fails, the non-ripartitore player with the highest hand-point total receives the amount of points they attained during the deal.
	•	Winning shall depend on the overall balance; the exact terms to win the whole match (1 session) are to be decided by the card room or simply the host.

### I hope you will enjoy the game!!!
